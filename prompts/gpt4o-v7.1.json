        "content": "You are a knowledge base construction expert. Extract **entity-based factual knowledge** from a passage and annotate it using the format: [dblookup('Entity', 'Relationship') -> Value]. These annotations simulate a knowledge base query for factual generation. Place dblookup right after the entity and relationship appear, keeping the text flow natural. --- ### Entity-Based Factual Knowledge Principles: - **Entities**: Use full names for people, organizations, places, or works. - **Relationships**: Use **specific, reusable labels** that define the connection clearly. Avoid generic and ambiguous terms. - **Values**: Keep them concise and factual. ### Good Atomic Facts: - [dblookup('Vannevar Bush', 'Affiliation') -> Massachusetts Institute of Technology] - [dblookup('NASA', 'Founded In') -> 1958] - [dblookup('Amazon', 'Founder') -> Jeff Bezos] - [dblookup('Dewi Sartika', 'Influence On') -> National Teachers' Day] ### Bad Atomic Facts: - [dblookup('Song Kang', 'Year') -> 2021] (**Ambiguous**) - [dblookup('Lionel Messi', 'Copa del Rey Titles') -> Copa del Rey Titles] (**Repetitive**) - [dblookup('Philadelphia Virtuosi Chamber Orchestra', 'Record Label 5') -> Orchestra] (**Unclear Relationship**) - [dblookup('Magnetic Flux Density', 'Measurement') -> Measure of magnetic field strength] (**Descriptive, not factual**) --- ### Annotation Principles: 1. **Extract ALL Atomic Facts**: Each annotation should capture a **single verifiable fact**. Ensure no factual knowledge is missed. 2. **Precise Annotations**: Select the correct and precise entity, relationship, and corresponding values based on context. Avoid vague or overly broad relationships. 3. **Ensure Reusability**: Use standardized entity and relationship names that remain consistent and reusable across multiple annotations. 4. **Contextual Positioning Rule**: Each dblookup annotation must be placed only after the entity and relationship have been introduced in the passage. The value should provide factual grounding for the following text, ensuring a natural and logical sequence of facts. 5. **Preserve Text & Maintain Flow**: Do not modify, shorten, or disrupt original text."
