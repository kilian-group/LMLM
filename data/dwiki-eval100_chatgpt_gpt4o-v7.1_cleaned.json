            "text": "Charvet (fabric)\n\nA charvet fabric is woven of silk or acetate in warp-faced rib weave, of a reversed reps type with a double ridge effect. The fabric's name derives from its frequent and \"clever\" use in the 19th century by the Parisian shirtmaker Charvet. It is characterized by a soft handle and shiny appearance. It also drapes well. The bindings create a herringbone effect parallel to the warp, which make this weave suitable for creating faint diagonal stripe effects for ties, for which the fabric is cut on the bias. Patterns on this base are often made with supplementary weft. The fabric has also been used for mufflers, scarves and robes.\nThis weave is based on the \"R\u00e9gence\" weave, a kind of reps with all weft raised on the backside, which was popular during the regency of Philippe II, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans (lasting from 1715 to 1723). In the United States, at the end of the 19th century, the term was used in a broader sense, to describe either fabrics \"extremely dainty in construction and effect\" or silk shirtings. Since the beginning of the 20th century, the weave is rather found in solid fabrics for semi formal wear.\nBy extension, the term is also used in knitting for a certain kind of bias striping, going up from left to right.",

Alistair Blake Arabella) joined the team and would later become Managing Editor. Erin Barnes (a.k.a. Angora Holly Polo) is founder and Editor-in-Chief.\nFeatures.\nThe Donnybrook Writing Academy featured a variety of previews, reviews, podcasts, and interviews on the categories of music, film, photography, politics, video games, sex, and society. \"On the Record\" was a daily-updated record review column; \"Soundcheck\" was a local concert calendar and podcast; \"Ask Alistair\" was a snob's approach to the classic advice column; and the \"Snobcast\" was a podcast created by elitists. Other columns included \"Bartender Blogs,\" \"A Night Out With,\" \"the Problem of Leisure,\" \"Thematically Speaking,\" and \"Handjob and a Reuben.\"\nContent and Style.\nDonnybrook's mission, to create \"a society for cultural advancement,\" also drew heavily on indie and local Denver music scenes for content and inspiration. Stylistically, the site was a satire of classic writings that describe upper-crust society - from Fitzgerald to Jane Austen to the French salon culture - and since it was made up of somewhat young and destitute artists, writers, and musicians, it could be considered an ironic comment on the socioeconomic status of artists in contemporary American society. In that vein, the group was known for throwing such parties as \"The Fundraiser for the Rich\" to \"replace Donnybrook's pool filter.\" in venues that are notoriously divey, such as the Larimer Lounge. Donnybrook paradoxically embraced and poked fun at elitism, as a phenomenon that is relevant in today's culture - where too much access to art, music, and the means to create it has created a backlash of cultural policing.",
