Opened in stages between 1964 and 1965, it was the first enclosed mall developed by Melvin Simon &amp; Associates, now known as Simon Property Group. The mall's original anchor stores were H. P. Wasson and Company, Montgomery Ward, and J. C. Penney; over time, the Wasson store became Meis, Elder-Beerman, and Carson's, while Montgomery Ward became Sears and J. C. Penney was torn down and rebuilt as a movie theater. After a period of decline, Mounds Mall closed to the public in April 2018. The movie theater closed a year later, leaving no businesses in the building.\nHistory.\nMounds Mall was developed by Melvin Simon &amp; Associates (now Simon Property Group), opening in 1965 as the company's first mall and the second mall in Indiana (Evansville's fully enclosed Washington Square began business in October 1963). \nThe mall officially opened in April 1965, although anchor stores Montgomery Ward and H. P. Wasson and Company had opened the previous November. Original tenants included Zales, Kroger, Woolworth, and Jo-Ann Fabrics.\nMontgomery Ward closed and became Sears in 1983. Also in the 1980s, the Wasson\u2019s store closed. Meis opened a store around a year later, Meis was rebranded into Elder-Beerman in 1983, and finally Carson's in 2011. In 2012, the Sears closed as a result of low sales of the 2011 holiday season. On January 31, 2018, The Bon-Ton announced that Carson's would be closing as part of a plan to close 42 stores nationwide. The store closed on April 29th, 2018. Shortly later, it was announced that the whole mall would close along with the Carson's. The mall closed on April 1, 2018.",

It tells the story of the leader of a British right-wing populist party who has decided to have his internal rival assassinated. To provide an alibi for himself he stays on a small Channel Island, where he becomes fascinated by a very self-possessed young woman. It was Hopkins' [dblookup('Bill Hopkins', 'First Published Novel') -> The Divine and the Decay] first and only published novel.\n\nPlot.\nPeter Plowart, the leader and co-founder of the right-wing populist New Britain Party has decided to have his party co-founder assassinated due to internal conflicts. He travels to Vachau, one of the Channel Islands, to hold a speech and thus give himself an alibi while the assassination is carried out. On the island he finds a young woman whose self-possession intrigues him and makes him want to conquer her. When the woman finds out about Peter's real reason for staying on the island, she decides that he has to die. A power struggle takes place between the two.\n\nConception.\nAccording to Bill Hopkins' friend Colin Wilson, the book had its background in the nightly conversations the two had in [dblookup('Bill Hopkins and Colin Wilson', 'Conversation Location') -> Paris] Paris in [dblookup('Bill Hopkins and Colin Wilson', 'Conversation Year') -> 1953] 1953. Both Hopkins and Wilson admired a set of authors active around year 1900\u2014 George Bernard Shaw, H. G. Wells, G. K. Chesterton, and Anatole France\u2014and preferred these to the generations which had followed. Wilson attributed this to the atmosphere of defeat in the works of later generations; he exemplified this with the treatment of [dblookup('Friedrich Nietzsche', 'Criticism By') -> Bertrand Russell] Friedrich Nietzsche in Bertrand Russell's influential \"A History of Western Philosophy\", where Nietzsche's use of the word \"will\" is reduced to being associated with Nazi Germany. According to Wilson, both he and Hopkins found \"will\" to be \"the only valid starting point for philosophy\", and they both found Nietzsche's phrase about \"how one becomes what one is\" to be of central value.\n\nThe fictional island of Vachau is based on Sark. Hopkins visited Sark in [dblookup('Bill Hopkins', 'Visited Sark Year') -> 1956] 1956 to do research for the novel.\n\nPublication.\nThe book was accepted by [dblookup('The Divine and the Decay', 'Publisher') -> MacGibbon & Kee] MacGibbon & Kee at the height of the angry young men movement, which Hopkins was associated with, and published in [dblookup('The Divine and the Decay', 'Publication Year') -> 1957] 1957. It was republished as \"The Leap\" by Deverell & Birdsey in [dblookup('The Leap', 'Republished Year') -> 1984] 1984.\n\nReception and legacy.\nThe book was heavily attacked by critics upon the publication. Graham Hough of \"Encounter\" called it \"an adolescent power-fantasy, extremely shoddily written\", and wrote: What is surprising, after the history of the last thirty years, is that even the naivest masturbations of the most unhappy young man should be able to take this openly Fascist form. The fact that this performance has been treated in some quarters with a moderate respect shows that there is a dangerous vacuum in our present culture that could easily be filled with highly unpleasant material; though not, I should have thought, with anything as poisonously silly as this.

            "text": "The Divine and the Decay\n\nThe Divine and the Decay is a 1957 novel by the Welsh writer Bill Hopkins. It was republished as The Leap, in 1984. It tells the story of the leader of a British right-wing populist party who has decided to have his internal rival assassinated. To provide an alibi for himself he stays on a small Channel Island, where he becomes fascinated by a very self-possessed young woman. It was Hopkins' first and only published novel.\nPlot.\nPeter Plowart, the leader and co-founder of the right-wing populist New Britain Party has decided to have his party co-founder assassinated due to internal conflicts. He travels to Vachau, one of the Channel Islands, to hold a speech and thus give himself an alibi while the assassination is carried out. On the island he finds a young woman whose self-possession intrigues him and makes him want to conquer her. When the woman finds out about Peter's real reason for staying on the island, she decides that he has to die. A power struggle takes place between the two.\nConception.\nAccording to Bill Hopkins' friend Colin Wilson, the book had its background in the nightly conversations the two had in Paris in 1953. Both Hopkins and Wilson admired a set of authors active around year 1900\u2014George Bernard Shaw, H. G. Wells, G. K. Chesterton and Anatole France\u2014and preferred these to the generations which had followed. Wilson attributed this to the atmosphere of defeat in the works of later generations; he exemplified this with the treatment of Friedrich Nietzsche in Bertrand Russell's influential \"A History of Western Philosophy\", where Nietzsche's use of the word \"will\" is reduced to being associated with Nazi Germany. According to Wilson, both he and Hopkins found \"will\" to be \"the only valid starting point for philosophy\", and they both found Nietzsche's phrase about \"how one becomes what one is\" to be of central value.\nThe fictional island of Vachau is based on Sark. Hopkins visited Sark in 1956 to do research for the novel.\nPublication.\nThe book was accepted by MacGibbon &amp; Kee at the height of the angry young men movement, which Hopkins was associated with, and published in 1957. It was republished as \"The Leap\" by Deverell &amp; Birdsey in 1984.\nReception and legacy.\nThe book was heavily attacked by critics upon the publication. Graham Hough of \"Encounter\" called it \"an adolescent power-fantasy, extremely shoddily written\", and wrote:\nWhat is surprising, after the history of the last thirty years, is that even the naivest masturbations of the most unhappy young man should be able to take this openly Fascist form. The fact that this performance has been treated in some quarters with a moderate respect shows that there is a dangerous vacuum in our present culture that could easily be filled with highly unpleasant material; though not, I should have thought, with anything as poisonously silly as this.\nAccording to Wilson, Hopkins remained self-confident on the surface despite the book's reception, but was shaken by what Wilson described as \"character assassination\", as opposed to normal literary controversy. When the typescript for Hopkins' second novel, \"Time and Totality\", was accidentally destroyed by fire, Hopkins did not bother to rewrite it.",

The lake is in Eldorado National Forest in the Sierra Nevada at an elevation of .\nIt was formed in 1963 by the high earth and rockfill Union Valley Dam on Silver Creek, which is a tributary of the American River. The reservoir is part of the Upper American River Project of the Sacramento Municipal Utility District, a public electric utility, which operates the dam and many other dams in the area. Recreation such as boating, fishing and camping is available there.\nIt stores snow melt runoff during the spring and releases it during the summer when electrical demand is greatest to a chain of hydroelectric power plants downstream. Union Valley Powerhouse at the base of the dam has a capacity of 46.7 MW and is operated as a peaking power plant, supplying electricity during times of the greatest demand. Consumptive rights to the water itself are held by the City of Sacramento, California.\nThe reservoir is fed by Big Silver Creek, Jones Fork Silver Creek, Tells Creek, Wench Creek and the outflows of Robbs Peak and Jones Fork powerhouses. Jones Fork Powerhouse is not on Jones Fork Silver Creek but instead conveys water from Ice House Reservoir. Robbs Peak Powerhouse gets its water from the Middle Fork American River headwaters, by way of Loon Lake Reservoir, and small reservoirs on Gerle Creek and South Fork Rubicon River. Downstream from Union Valley Dam, Silver Creek waters are largely diverted through two additional powerhouses below small reservoirs before joining the South Fork American River a few miles north of Pollock Pines, California. Silver Creek was an intermittent creek before the development of Union Valley Reservoir and the diversions from the Middle Fork American River.",

It descends south-south west for 2.5\u00a0km below the Col Infranchissable, then turns south-east to merge with other glaciers, thence continuing as the Glacier du Miage (Ghiacciaio del Miage) \u2013 a total distance of approximately 9\u00a0km, forming the longest glacier in Italy.\nThe Glacier de Miage \u2013 not to be confused with the much larger Glacier \"du\" Miage on the Italian side (see above) \u2013 forms from snows collecting between the Aiguille de Tricot and the south-western face of the Aiguille de Bionnassay. The glacier descends in a south-westerly direction for approximately 2.5\u00a0km.\nAlpinism.\nHistory.\nThe first ascent of the Aiguille de Bionnassay was undertaken on 28 July 1865 by Florence Crauford Grove, Edward N. Buxton and Reginald S. McDonald, with guides Jean Pierre Cachat and Michel Payot. They ascended the north-west face to reach the ridge above the Aiguille de Tricot, from where they continued to the knife-edged summit ridge, arriving in a thunderstorm. A detailed account is given below.\nThe mountain's south ridge was first climbed on 13 July 1888 by Kaspar Maurer, Andreas Jaun and the Austrian diplomat Georg Gruber.\nThe east ridge was first climbed in descent as part of a traverse from the D\u00f4mes de Miage by Katharine Richardson, Emile Rey and Jean-Baptiste Bich on 13 August 1888.\nThe long west ridge was first climbed in its entirety from the Col de Tricot in 1911 by Fraulein Eleonore Hasenclever and Freulein H. Wirthl with M. Helff, K.G. von Saar and Richard Weitzenbock.\nThe complete north-west face route was finally climbed in 1926 by billionaire businessman and art collector, Robert Wylie Lloyd, with his guides Adolf and Josep Pollinger.\nThe first winter ascent of the Aiguille de Bionnassay was made on 20 March 1929 by A. Charlet, F. Frison Roche, H. Hoerlin, E.Schneider and H. Schroeder.\nThe north face was first climbed on 30\u201331 August 1953 by Bertrand Kempf and Claude Laurendeau. It is ranked as one of the most difficult ice walls in the Alps, and is rarely attempted.",

It was critically acclaimed but it did not perform well at the box office.\nPlot.\nSet against the backdrop of the new culture of bandhs (general strikes) that frequently immobilize post-conflict Nepal, \"Highway\" explores five different relationship stories that become intertwined during an ill-fated bus journey from eastern Nepal to the capital Kathmandu. While the passengers - each of whom urgently needs to be somewhere else await a resolution to the combustible strike that is blocking the only passable road, the film explores the psychological and spiritual bandhs that many Nepalese contend with.\nSoundtrack.\nThe soundtrack of \"Highway\", titled \"Paplu (Laija Re)\", was released on Kantipur FM on 26 October 2011. It was composed by Manoj Kumar KC of 1974 AD with lyrics penned by Bhupendra Khadka. Subhani Moktan recorded the song for the film.",

            "text": "Hohenlychen Sanatorium\n\nThe Hohenlychen Sanatorium was a complex of sanatoriums in Lychen, Uckermark district (a bit north of Berlin), Germany, that was in use from 1902 to 1945. The complex was originally built in 1902 to house tubercular children. By the 1930s the Hohenlychen Sanatorium had become one of the main medical facilities of the Schutzstaffel, where injured or convalescing SS-men were treated.\nThird Reich use.\nMany preeminent SS doctors trained or were stationed at Hohenlychen, the most infamous being SS-Gruppenf\u00fchrer Doctor Karl Gebhardt, who was sentenced to death for war crimes. In 1935, Gebhardt was appointed Medical Superintendent of Hohenlychen Sanatorium, which he changed from a sanatorium for tuberculosis patients into an orthopedic clinic. At Hohenlychen Sanatorium, Gebhardt started the first sports medicine clinic in Germany and developed sports programs for amputees and other disabled people. Gebhardt was also appointed to the Deutsche Hochschule f\u00fcr Leibes\u00fcbungen (German College for Physical Education) in 1935, where he became the first professor of sports medicine in Berlin. Hohenlychen Sanatorium became the sports sanatorium for the Third Reich and served as the central hospital for the athletes who participated in the 1936 Summer Olympics. In the final days of the Third Reich, April 1945, Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS Heinrich Himmler left Berlin for Hohenlychen.\nAfter World War II.\nThe German military evacuated Hohenlychen before the Red Army arrived on April 29, 1945. Some of the buildings were used as barracks, and the other buildings were utilized as a military hospital until August 31, 1993. Hohenlychen is now abandoned except for infrequent visits by photographers and tourists.\nAfter 2005.\nMichael Neumann, an engineer from Freiberg, bought part of the site - nine buildings on 12 hectares - from the state of Brandenburg in 2009. Neumann then developed a concept for a Parkresidenz Lychen. In his spirit - he died in 2019 - his daughter Anne Neumann continued to operate these plans with her life partner Gregory Kashkin and relatives. There are now 44 barrier-free rental apartments there, almost all of which have already been occupied, as well as ten vacation apartments and a bistro. 40 percent of the listed building fabric has already been renovated. More vacation homes and 15 rental apartments are to be added in the coming year.\nIn literature.\nIn the Prix Goncourt winning novel, Les Bienveillantes, the Hohenlychen Sanatorium was the location of the protagonist Maximilian Aue's hospitalisation after having been shot in the head at Stalingrad.\nSources.\nHans Waltrich. \"Aufstieg und Niedergang der Heilanstalten Hohenlychen (1902 bis 1945).\" Strelitzia, Blankensee Press, 2001.\nExternal links.\nHohenlychen Sanatorium and its hidden history of human experiments",

An Australia international and New South Wales state representative three-quarter back, he played in Sydney for the Balmain club, with whom he won the 1947 NSWRFL Premiership.\nRugby career.\nA quick-paced , Lulham came to Sydney from Newcastle and in his first season in the NSWRFL premiership represented New South Wales in all matches. In the 1947 NSWRFL season he was also the League's top try-scorer, breaking the record for most tries in a debut season with 28 and most tries in a season for Balmain Tigers in the club's history. At the end of the season he played in Balmain's grand final win. At the end of the following season he was selected to tour Europe with the 1948\u201349 Kangaroos, making his debut in the Third Test against Great Britain before going on to play two Tests against France.\nPoisoning.\nIn July 1953, Lulham was in the headlines after his mother-in-law, Veronica Mabel Monty, 45, was charged with attempted murder, after giving him \"Thall-rat\", a rat poison containing thallium. It soon hit the media, as it was one of 46 similar cases of thallium poisoning in Australia, the \"thallium craze\", leading to 10 deaths in the early 1950s. Monty was charged and arrested in August. Monty was also poisoned with thallium while on bail, but recovered as the dose was low.\nThe sensational hearing in Sydney revealed that Monty had moved in with her daughter, Judy, and son-in-law in June 1952 following an operation and separation from her husband. The Lulhams had been married only six months when her mother had moved in. Lulham and Monty then had an \"intimate relationship\" three times. Once, on 26 June 1953, after Judy had gone to bed early while listening to the Ashes test from Lords, once while Judy was at church, and again when he had come home from work early. Monty testified she made a poisoned Milo for herself on 2 July as she was contemplating suicide, but the Lulhams asked for drinks too and she mistook the cups. In September 1953, she was ordered to stand trial. In December, Monty was found not guilty.\nPersonal life.\nLulham was born on Tuesday 2 November 1926, into a family of three boys. His father was a veteran of the Gallipoli Campaign.\nJudy Lulham divorced him in early 1955 as a result of the revelations about his affair with her mother. Her father also divorced her mother at the same time.

He received his education at Wingate University, Queens College, the University of North Carolina, and through extensive private studies. Among his early teachers was concert pianist Winifred MacBride. He began his professional career at the age of 12, working as a pianist. By 15 he was also a professional organist, and thereafter added actor, singer, director, conductor, arranger, composer, and teacher to his impressive r\u00e9sum\u00e9.\nCareer.\nWentz composed the 1987 opera \"A Minuet\", based on the play of the same name by Louis N. Parker. His \"Requiem\", a one-hour work for four soloists, full chorus and orchestra, composed in 1989, drew the following comment from the opera star, Teresa Stratas: \"God bless you. I loved it! It is a wonderful work. You have a tremendous gift.\"\nThe American Composer Series paid tribute to the greatest composers of popular American music on the American scene, particularly those composers associated with Tin Pan Alley and the Great American Songbook. From 2000 to 2009, under the direction of Wentz, the American Composer Series created 15 original revues, many of them returning for multiple runs over the years. Composers saluted in the series include Milton Ager, Harold Arlen, Nacio Herb Brown, Hoagy Carmichael, Sammy Fain, Ray Henderson, Victor Herbert, James V. Monaco, Richard Rodgers, Jule Styne, and Harry Warren.

Following the parliamentary election of 1992, Kamikamica and five of his supporters had left the Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei of Sitiveni Rabuka and unsuccessfully challenged him for the Prime Ministership, attempting to build a coalition government with the Indo-Fijian opposition. The party won [dblookup('Fijian Association Party', 'Seats Won in 1994 Election') -> five] five seats in the general election of 1994, which was called three years early because of political instability. Following Kamikamica's death from cancer in 1996, \"Ratu\" Finau Mara (the son of then-President \"Ratu Sir\" Kamisese Mara) took over the leadership. In 1998, he was replaced by [dblookup('Fijian Association Party', 'Leader in 1998') -> Adi Kuini Speed] \"Adi\" Kuini Speed, the widow of former Fiji Labour Party (FLP) Prime Minister Timoci Bavadra, who had been deposed in a coup led by Rabuka, then a lieutenant colonel in the army, in 1987.

            "text": "Fijian Association Party\n\nThe Fijian Association Party (FAP) is a former political party in Fiji. It played a significant role in Fijian politics throughout the 1990s, but lost all of its seats in the House of Representatives in the parliamentary election of 2001.\nThe FAP was founded in 1994 by Josefata Kamikamica, head of the Native Land Trust Board and a former Minister of Finance. Following the parliamentary election of 1992, Kamikamica and five of his supporters had left the Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei of Sitiveni Rabuka and unsuccessfully challenged him for the Prime Ministership, attempting to build a coalition government with the Indo-Fijian opposition. The party won five seats in the general election of 1994, which was called three years early because of political instability. Following Kamikamica's death from cancer in 1996, \"Ratu\" Finau Mara (the son of then-President \"Ratu Sir\" Kamisese Mara) took over the leadership. In 1998, he was replaced by \"Adi\" Kuini Speed, the widow of former Fiji Labour Party (FLP) Prime Minister Timoci Bavadra, who had been deposed in a coup led by Rabuka, then a lieutenant colonel in the army, in 1987. Speed joined the FAP in 1995 after falling out with her late husband's party over the direction in which Mahendra Chaudhry, the new leader, was taking it.\nIn the parliamentary election of 1999, the FAP joined with Chaudhry's FLP as part of the People's Coalition, an electoral alliance which also included a number of smaller parties. The FLP, supported mostly by Indo-Fijians, sought partnerships with parties led by ethnic Fijians in order to broaden its support base. The FAP won ten seats in the 71-member House of Representatives, its best result ever. The FAP initially proposed Speed for Prime Minister, saying that she would be more acceptable to indigenous Fijians than Chaudhry. President Mara, however, persuaded her to accept Chaudhry as Prime Minister, pointing out that the FLP had won a majority - 37 seats - in its own right. Towards the end of 1999, Speed survived a challenge to her leadership of the FAP in a divisive High Court case, which resulted in backbencher Ratu Tu'uakitau Cokanauto and his supporters splitting from the party.\nThe government of which the FAP was a part was deposed in the Fiji coup of 2000, instigated by George Speight.

In April 2005, this party dissolved itself in order to merge with the newly formed National Alliance Party of Fiji, founded by \"Ratu\" Epeli Ganilau. A rump of the FAP continued for some time, under the leadership of Ratu Inoke Seru.",

Despite pleas from both the media and the fans to continue the rivalry, no games were scheduled between the two programs for 15 seasons.\nRivalry renewal.\nIn May 2015, following UAB's NCAA tournament upset over 3-seed Iowa State and Bruce Pearl's first season at Auburn, UAB announced that they had reached an agreement to play Auburn in a four-game series. The first game would be played at Auburn, the second at UAB, then back at Auburn, then finally at Legacy Arena. (formerly the BJCC) Auburn won the first game of the series renewal in front of a sold out Auburn Arena, 75\u201374, on a 3-pointer in the final seconds of the game. In 2016, Auburn defeated UAB in the first game played at Bartow Arena in the series since 1996, 74\u201370. Auburn lead the entire game in a 85\u201380 victory to tie the series at 10 games apiece in 2017. Carrying a #8 ranking into the 2018 matchup, Auburn managed to survive a scare from UAB in overtime at Legacy Arena, 75\u201371, completing the series sweep against the Blazers. Auburn and UAB have not met since.",

He continued to take part until the match finished, but collapsed at home afterwards and died in hospital four days later from diabetes mellitus and heart failure 'accelerated by the rough usage of the opposing team' \nThis tragic end to Thorpe's career led to a change in the rules, where players were no longer allowed to raise their foot to a goalkeeper when he had control of the ball in his arms. Though Thorpe may be little known, even in the North East, goalkeepers around the world doubtlessly owe a debt to him. The changed rules now says that players cannot kick the ball out of the goalkeeper's hands. Sunderland went on to win the Championship that same year, and his medal was presented to his widow. During the 75th Anniversary of the game between Sunderland and Chelsea both goalkeepers wore black armbands as a mark of respects for Jimmy's efforts.\nHe was survived by his wife May and three-year-old son Ronnie. Some 70 years after Jimmy Thorpe's death, his son contributed towards a book penned by local historian John Kelters, \"1 Jimmy Thorpe\". May Thorpe remarried in 1940 to John Linklater Battye. Widowed again on the death of her second husband in 1976, she later moved to Lancashire, and died at Ulverston in the county in 1991, at the age of 77.",

According to Felipe de Leon, Jr., an authority on Philippine music, the song was composed in a Western style but has aspects of \"pasyon\", a form that many Filipinos can identify with.\nImpact.\n\"Anak\" became a finalist in the first MetroPop Song Festival. It went on to become very popular in the Philippines and eventually abroad. The song generated a hundred cover versions, was released in 56 countries and in 27 different foreign languages, and is claimed to have sold 30 million copies. This was unlikely, however, and only threea songs have been confirmed to have sold at least 30 million copies.\nAn eponymous film was released in 2000, with a plot inspired by the lyrics of the song.\nIn popular culture.\nMedia.\n\"Anak\", in both Filipino and Korean versions, was featured in the 2015 South Korean action film Gangnam Blues.",

JNCO also manufactures T-shirts, khaki pants and other clothing articles for men and women.

            "text": "JNCO\n\nJNCO, short for \"Judge None Choose One\", is a Los Angeles, California-based clothing company specializing in boys' and men's jeans. \nHistory.\nJNCO was founded in 1985 by Moroccan-born, French-raised brothers Jacques Yaakov Revah and Haim Milo Revah. The brand gained recognition in the 1990s with its boys' ultra-wide straight legged denim jeans featuring elaborate pocket logos and a unique street look. The brothers commissioned a local LA graffiti artist Joseph Montalvo, aka Nuke, to design the brand's logo. This street look was popularized throughout the 90s starting in Los Angeles and working its way through the United States. JNCO also manufactures T-shirts, khaki pants and other clothing articles for men and women. Unlike similar California based apparel manufacturers, JNCO manufactured most of its products in the United States, mainly at S.M.J. American Manufacturing Co., a operation also owned by Milo and Jacques Revah.\nAfter peak sales of $186.9 million, sales halved in 1999. In the 2000s, the brothers closed the main factory.\nIn 2015, the brand was relaunched, backed by Chinese investment firm Guotai Litian, which acquired it for a reported seven-figure amount. However the new products were reported to be of lower quality, which resulted in increased demand for the original jeans on secondary marketplaces such as eBay.\nOn February 15, 2018, it was announced that JNCO was to cease production and liquidate its inventory. It was later clarified that this applied to the then-current licensed production under Guotai Litian, and that the brand would continue under new management.\nIn 2019, original founder Milo Revah announced he had re-acquired the brand and intended to relaunch it alongside his daughter Camilla. This second relaunch took place on June 28 of that year, along with a new website.\nStyles.\nAfter JNCOs grew in popularity, department store chains such as Kohl's and J. C.

            "text": "All About Tonight (Blake Shelton song)\n\n\"All About Tonight\" is a song written by Rhett Akins, Dallas Davidson, and Ben Hayslip, also known as The Peach Pickers, and recorded by American country music artist Blake Shelton. It serves as the first single from \"All About Tonight\", his second extended play, and seventh studio release.\nContent.\nThe lyrics in \"All About Tonight\" focus around partying and living in the moment. Co-writer Rhett Akins told The Boot that they wanted to write a song about how they don't care about tomorrow because tomorrow can wait until tomorrow. Akins said \"we just went from there and touched on things like I know I'm going to have a headache in the morning, and I'll probably be broke. There's no telling what we're going to do, and I don't even care because it's all about tonight. That's all I'm worried about! It's a good, fun party song about where the night is going to go. After we wrote it, we thought it sounds just like a Blake Shelton song.\"\nCritical reception.\nGiving the song four and-a-half out of five stars, Matt Bjorke of Roughstock stated that \"Even if \u201cAll About Tonight\u201d isn\u2019t a \u2018deep\u2019 song, it has that southern rock melody mixed with a good time joe attitude that clearly makes \u201cAll About Tonight\u201d one of the most obvious hit singles of Blake Shelton\u2019s career to date\"\nBlake Boldt with \"Engine 145\" gave the song a \"thumbs down\" rating, saying that \"Shelton convinces as a liquored-up barfly who\u2019s itching for his next conquest. In a radio climate that favors long-term love affairs, a song that even suggests a one-night stand is a slightly-bold move. That\u2019s about the only risk taken on \u201cTonight,\u201d which swings along on a standard modern-country production with a touch of twang. The nifty slide guitar line in the bridge is a neat twist, but the rest of \u201cTonight\u201d is a forgettable template plugged into a filler tune.\"\nMusic video.\nA live music video for the song was made and premiered on Country Music Television on June 16, 2010. It was directed by Jon Small. This is Blake's first live performance video.\nChart performance.\n\"All About Tonight\" debuted at No. 45 on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Hot Country Songs chart in April 2010. For the week of August 28, 2010, the song became his seventh Number One on the Hot Country Songs chart.",

In late 1959, all of the Professional Series of Amps were debuted at the summer NAMM show. They sported a new light brown Tolex covering, solid state rectifiers (with the exception of the Super Amp), tweed style grill cloth and short-lived metal control knobs (later replaced with the more common brown plastic barrel knobs). In 1961 there was a short run of blond concert amps delivered to Webb music shop in California but the majority were transitioned to standard brown tolex with either maroon/obxlood grill cloth (1961) or the more common yellow or \"wheat\" cloth (1962). By the end of 1963 and into early 1964, the Concert amp transitioned into black tolex with silver grill along with the rest of the Fender Amplifier line.

While living in the Channel Islands 1888\u20131895, Marquand and his wife had recorded the presence and distribution of 236 seaweeds, increasing this to 252 by 1901.

Lyle recorded this rarely found species during her own work in 1911, and it has not been found in the UK since.\n\nIn 1920, Lyle published \"The Marine Algae of Guernsey,\" adding 46 species to Marquand's records for the island. The publication of this had been delayed by the war, but over the course of the following decade, she published several further papers on the seaweeds found among the Channel Islands. Despite their being studied by others, Lyle stated that \"one need never despair of making new discoveries\" around the Islands, where \"in no two years does it seem possible to find all the same algae\". This was partly due to the regular arrival of new species, such as Colpomenia peregrina, a brown seaweed not native to the British Isles.

The species bears her name.\n\nLyle explored Guernsey's marine ecology in detail, and later compared it to that found elsewhere. In 1926, for example, Lyle was involved in counting and recording algae growth on hulls, near Scapa Flow in the Orkney Islands. The vessels studied were from a salvaged fleet of German warships, an opportunity 'so unusual as to be valuable' despite the number of years passed since their sinking. The following year, Lyle discussed her experiences examining the fleet before the Linnean Society, illustrating her talk with lantern slides.\n\nThough collecting, pressing, and presenting flowers and seaweeds was a popular pastime during the Victorian period in particular, leading to a number of albums finding their way into museum collections, Lyle's represents the 'one serious academic collection' in the [dblookup('Guille-All\u00e8s Museum of Guernsey', 'Significant Collection') -> Lilian Lyle's seaweed collection] Guille-All\u00e8s Museum of Guernsey.

Her records in Guernsey were published in the Transactions of the Guernsey Society of Natural Science (later La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Guernesiaise).\nIn October 1921, Lyle discovered a new genus of algae, which she wrote about in 'Antithamnionella, A New Genus of Algae', published in the \"Journal of Botany\" in 1922. The species bears her name.\nLyle explored Guernsey's marine ecology in detail, and later compared it that found elsewhere. In 1926, for example, Lyle was involved in counting and recording algae growth on hulls, near Scapa Flow in the Orkney Islands. The vessels studied were from a salvaged fleet of German warships, an opportunity 'so unusual as to be valuable' despite the number of years passed since their sinking. The following year, Lyle discussed her experiences examining the fleet before the Linnean Society, illustrating her talk with lantern slides.\nThough collecting, pressing, and presenting flowers and seaweeds was a popular pastime during the Victorian period in particular, leading to a number of albums finding their way into museum collections, Lyle's represents the 'one serious academic collection' in the Guille-All\u00e8s Museum of Guernsey. Lyle presented this album \u2013 containing mounted dried specimens and microscope slides \u2013 to the museum, and also donated material to the British Museum and the National Library of Wales.\nIn her later life, Lyle was still sharing her observations: the Natural History Museum holds a letter written to Dr John Ramsbottom on 18 April 1947 containing a list of flowers found in Tintagel and the surrounding area between 1941 and 1945.\nDeath.\nLilian Lyle died on 6 May 1953 in a nursing home in Bromley, aged 86.",

A collaborative object is a JSON-like object that can be shared by some users (or groups) that can make changes in real-time. Changes are propagated (and notified) in real-time to any user connected to the object.\nA collaborative object can store properties of simple data types (string, integers, etc.) as well as rich-text and references to files or attachments. This approach is suitable to implement any document based collaborative application like text editors or spreadsheets.\nObjects and participants are uniquely identified on the Internet enabling decentralized access from different federated servers.\nApplications using SwellRT.\nSwellRT facilitated the development of mobile/web apps, and thus several apps have been built using this technology. Apart from the demos provided by SwellRT, third-parties developed other demo apps such as a Q&amp;A site, an extension to extract keywords, a collaborative scrollbar, a political participation Android app, a Trello-SwellRT connector.

In 1991 he travelled in Europe and Australia where he led his own group in Sydney, before returning to London in 1992. In 1993 he formed a new group and started performing his own music for the first time, much of which was inspired by his travels. He performed again at Ronnie Scott's, as well as the 606 Club, the Vortex and other prestigious clubs in London. In 1995 he joined the Mike Westbrook Orchestra, playing at British Jazz Festivals and touring in Europe, and in 1996 he was a featured soloist on Westbrook's \"Bar Utopia\" album. In 1997 he helped form \"Sound Arts\", a community based youth music project in North Kensington. At the heart of the project was a recording studio in which he learnt many of the skills he would later use to record his own music. \nIn 1999 he formed a new Quintet, with performances at the 606 Club, a monthly residency at Lauderdale House, a standing ovation at the Tabernacle and a week at Ronnie Scott's again in January 2000. He then turned his hand to the piano, an instrument he had played since he was 13 but had hitherto used only as a compositional tool. He formed a Quartet in which he played the piano and synthesizer on his own compositions and the trumpet on well known jazz standards. The group also featured the talented Colin Oxley on guitar. Oxley's sensitive style and semi-acoustic sound suited the original compositions perfectly, blending with the piano/synthesizer to create a warm, lush texture. The band's residency continued at Lauderdale House where they began recording their performances and this culminated in the album, \"Lilyfield\", in 2001.\nCurrent Work.\nSince 2003 he has focused on composing, recording and teaching. As a composer he has created a suite of albums which include many of his original compositions documenting his life experiences. These recordings include live performances and have been released on the Prince of Peace label. Recently he has been recording music in which he multi-tracks a range of instruments, all of which he plays himself, creating the entire soundscape in his own studio. The unique sound of these recordings is most well documented on his 8th album, \u201cNature Boy\u201d, which features a mix of his own music and some of his favourite jazz standards. Some of these tracks are also documented on his website www.journeyoftheheart.co.uk with a link to Soundcloud.\nDiscography.\nAs Sideman.\nWith National Youth Jazz Orchestra\nWith Cleveland Watkiss\nWith Loose Tubes\nWith Mike Westbrook\nWith Others",

It was popular enough to go into four editions by 1778, and interest in it has revived in the 21st century among feminist literary scholars. The book takes the form of a frame tale and a series of adventures, as the narrator's long-lost cousin relates how each of the residents arrived at the female utopia, Millenium Hall. The adventures are remarkable for their reliance on a nearly superstitious form of divine grace, where God's will manifests itself with the direct punishment of the wicked and the miraculous protection of the innocent. In one tale, a woman about to be ravished by a man is saved, literally by the hand of God, as her attacker dies of a stroke. The Hall the characters live in is a model of mid-century reform ideas. All the women have crafts with which to better themselves. Property is held in common, and education is the primary pastime. Elizabeth Montagu, Sarah Scott's sister, had become a leader of the bluestockings, a coterie of reform-minded individuals. They believed in female equality, education, and limited economic justice. Although Elizabeth may be lightly satirized in the figure of Lady Brumpton in \"Millenium Hall,\" the Hall is a fictional embodiment of bluestocking ideals. At the same time, there is a notable critique of heterosexual sexuality in \"Millenium Hall.\" This antipathy is usually expressed in religious terms, as all of the sexual acts in the novel are either forms of rape or sin. Further, the characters in the novel who are married or who have children are so without any indication of romantic love between the partners. Instead of romantic love, the novel posits female friendship under a powerful duty to piety. Female friendship is constant, but it is also emphatically antiseptic by being non-sexual. Although \"Millenium Hall\" has received renewed attention, it is not a novel that participates in the tradition of the novel in general as traditionally defined by scholarship. Sarah Scott's novel is not primarily interested in character (as Samuel Richardson's had been or Frances Burney's would be) or social act (as Henry Fielding's had been) or entertainment (as Aphra Behn's had been). Instead, her novel is directed toward morality, example, and, to some degree, a polemic of female education. It seeks to reform the individual female who might the novel and engage the male reader in pity. As the subtitle to the novel says, it contains \"Anecdotes and Reflections as May excite in the Reader proper Sentiments of Humanity, and lead the Mind to the Love of VIRTUE,\" with 'virtue' being understood in its masculine (\"virtus\") and feminine (\"virginity\") senses.",

While developing his own individual style, Krishna's music was greatly influenced by twentieth century stalwarts such as the vocalists Amir Khan, Bade Gulam Ali Khan, Abdul Karim Khan, Begum Akhtar, Shobha Gurtu as well as folk singers of Rajasthan. Krishna's repertoire in performance includes a wide variety of rare and old traditional compositions from these masters of music.\nCareer.\nKrishna Bhatt has received numerous awards and honors including the Sangeet Kalaratna (Jewel of Music) in 2009. He was also presented the \"Gunijan\" award by the President of India Mrs. Pratibha Patil in 2005 and was conferred the \"Kalashiroman\" samman by the Maharaja of Jodhpur Shri Gajsinghji and Shri John Singhji of Jaipur Virasat Foundation in 2007 in Rajasthan, India. Krishna Bhatt has been twice the recipient of the AIIS fellowship awards in 1998 and 2004 in the category of performing arts.\nIn addition to performing Hindustani classical music, Bhatt has also performed and recorded with the American composer Terry Riley (working on the score for the Alain Tanner film \"No Man's Land\"), Zakir Hussain, the Kronos Quartet, Jody Stecher, jazz saxophonist George Brooks, and Rajasthani folk musicians.\nHe plays tabla on Robert Ashley's 1978 record \"Private Parts\".\nHe divides his time between Jaipur, Rajasthan and New York City, where he continues to perform and teach.",

Some of these onscreen pairs have become couples in real life.

In the 21st century, love teams are also known by the portmanteaus of the couple's names. Becoming part of a love team in the Philippine entertainment industry can be a boost to the acting career of two people who are part of the pairing. The two people in a love team often star in television series and films with their characters. It is expected that their characters will be romantically attached like in line with their public image as a romantic couple off-screen. There are some organized fan groups supporting love teams. However, prospects of an actor or actress involved in a love team, especially the more popular pairings, to star with another actor or actress other than each other is limited. In cases where this happens, there is backlash from supporters of a love team, such as the case of [dblookup('Kathryn Bernardo', 'Involved In') -> Hello, Love, Goodbye] Kathryn Bernardo's involvement in the 2019 film \"Hello, Love, Goodbye\", where her character got paired with Alden Richards. Her pairing with Richards was not received well by KathNiel fans who support her being with [dblookup('Kathryn Bernardo', 'Traditional Partner') -> Daniel Padilla] Daniel Padilla instead. In that year, both Bernardo and Padilla mutually decided not to be involved in the same film project together. Hardcore fans of love teams wish for the pairing they support to become a \"real-life couple.\" One example of this is [dblookup('Gabby Concepcion', 'Married') -> Sharon Cuneta] Gabby Concepcion and Sharon Cuneta, who eventually got married. However, their marriage later got annulled. Traditionally, the \"success\" of love teams is influenced by the \"real-life relationship\" between the pairing members. However, love teams could involve actors and actresses who are not romantically in a relationship with each other, with even both members of the pair having open relationships with someone outside the pairing such as the case of Ruru Madrid and Shaira Diaz both of which are dating other people. In the case of [dblookup('Richard Yap', 'Marital Status') -> Married] Richard Yap and [dblookup('Jodi Sta. Maria', 'Relationship Status') -> Separated] Jodi Sta.

Within the entertainment industry, Actress Solenn Heussaff after conversing with people she knows are involved in love teams, said that being in such a pairing is difficult. She remarked that the love teams may \"lose a sense of who they are\" by trying too hard to portray themselves as romantic couples both on-screen and in real life, which she says is not good if it is forced in the case of the latter.

He designed part of the passage des Panoramas (11 boulevard Montmartre) in Paris, the main body of the building adjoining the entry to the Mus\u00e9e National de la Voiture et du Tourisme in Compi\u00e8gne (1859), and a hunting lodge near the Saint-Pierre ponds in the forest of Compi\u00e8gne (1860\u201361). He was named a chevalier of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur in 1857.\nHe lived at 2 rue Cr\u00e9billon in Paris during the 1830s and then at 20 rue de l'Od\u00e9on in the 1870s.",

The film has unprecedented access to Tesla, Inc. co-founder Elon Musk during this time period in which Musk and Tesla suffered several grave setbacks to the dream of a car company without gasoline. His foils include the charismatic Bob Lutz, vice chairman of General Motors during its 2008 bankruptcy, due in part to its focus on trucks and SUVs instead of fuel efficient and electric cars. Musk and Lutz also face Carlos Ghosn, the CEO credited with saving Renault-Nissan from near bankruptcy and who now had pledged $1 billion to beat Toyota to the pure electric game. A final character, steel fabrication artist, craftsman, prop builder and television personality Greg Abbott, who is known professionally as Reverend Gadget, makes the case for independent electric car conversions in California. Danny DeVito is also interviewed, as an electric car enthusiast and owner of a Chevrolet Volt and the earlier ill-fated General Motors EV1, as well as Internet entrepreneur and Tesla customer Jason Calacanis.\nWhereas the 2006 film \"Who Killed the Electric Car?\" ended with the destruction of 5,000 electric cars from California's clean air program, notably the GM EV1, the new film documents the rebirth of a new generation of electric cars that occurred in the early 2010s which included the Chevrolet Volt, the Nissan Leaf, and the Tesla Roadster.\nRelease and reception.\nThe documentary premiered at the 2011 Tribeca Film Festival on Earth Day, April 22, 2011 with David Duchovny, Elon Musk, Carlos Ghosn, and Bob Lutz in person. The theatrical release took place on October 21, 2011, in Los Angeles and New York, followed by openings in major metropolitan areas.\n\"Revenge of the Electric Car\" received mostly strong reviews. ABC's review praised the film, commenting, \"As much as you expect it to be a story about technology, it's really a tale about people. ... [The four entrepreneurs'] stories are skillfully woven together, each presented in their own voice.\" \"USA Today\" wrote, \"\"Revenge\" is a must-see movie for anyone interested in cars.\" \"The Guardian\" noted that the film \"is more than just a snapshot of the gamesmanship behind the creation of mass-market vehicles. \"Revenge\" offers a look inside the minds of business leaders struggling through one of the most troubled periods of recent economic history. ... [It] captures rich natural tension as it unfolds.\"\nThe film premiered on television in PBS's Independent Lens series in 2012 and was encored again in 2013 to strong ratings given the expanding popularity and interest in Tesla Motors with the release of its subsequent Model S electric car. Scenes from the film were featured on CBS's \"60 Minutes\" profile of Elon Musk with Bob Simon in 2014.",

            "text": "Kamaljit Neeru\n\nKamaljit Neeru, or simply Neeru, is a Punjabi singer and dancer. She is known for her stage performances as well has her vocal quality. She has released a total of ten albums to date. Her most popular songs to date are; \"Seeti Te Seeti, Jadon Mera Lak Hilda, Rurha Mandi Jave, and Bhij Gaye Kurti Laal\".\nBiography.\nNeeru began her career as a hobby in England in 1982, at the time, the Punjabi community there was beginning to create its own musical identity. Originally Punjabi music had all come from the Punjab, but there was a small Bhangra community in its infancy which was gaining popularity quite quickly. This was led by artists such as Alaap Group, Heera Group, Apna Sangeet, A.S Kang and DCS.\nOne day, while having dinner, a family friend Baldev Mastana who was a well-known music director in England asked Neeru to join his group \"The Saathi\u2019s\".\nNeeru's first album was a collaboration with other artists, \"Duppatte Kale Urde\" which was released in 1982 with HMV. In this Album, Neeru performed her single \"Behja Behja Hoju Mitra\".\nFollowing the success of her single in the album, Neeru went on to release 9 solo albums and 7 collaborations with other artists such as Hans Raj Hans, Sardool Sikander, Harbhajan Mann, Sabar Koti, Satwinder Bugga, Amar Noori and the late Parminder Sandhu.\nWhen she began her career, it was very difficult for a female singer to receive any degree or measurable success as a stage artist in the male dominated environment of Punjabi music, however she was able to break through these barriers and gain considerable success.\nNeeru has performed in almost each and every town and city in Punjab. She has performed in New Zealand, Australia, Dubai, Singapore, Malaysia, Holland, England, Canada and America.\nNeeru most recently has released three singles between 2017 and 2018 including Jago Wali Raat and her first devotional song Tor Dita Lalan Nu. In addition, she has been active on Punjabi Television as a judge on Miss PTC Punjabi in all seasons during 2017 and 2018 along with judging Mr. Punjab (Canada episode) in 2017.\nPersonal life.\nNeeru is originally from Khanna, India. She is one of five siblings. Her father was an officer in the Indian Military and due to this she traveled throughout India as a child. While in school, she was an avid track and field player and also took interest in swimming. Prior to her marriage, she was studying for her pre-medical avenue of education, however, when she was married, she moved to the United Kingdom in 1980 putting her education on hold and beginning her hobby in singing which became her profession.\nNeeru currently resides in Vancouver with her husband and her son, a police officer.",

It was offered in panel van and coup\u00e9 utility body styles.\nChrysler Australia added a panel van to their Chrysler CL Valiant range in April 1977, and a few weeks later they introduced the \"Drifter Pack\" as an option on that body style. The Drifter Pack included a Chrysler Charger grille, quartz halogen high beam headlights, a sports steering wheel, radial ply tyres, styled wheels and special exterior paint and decal treatment with colour-coded bumpers. The 4.3 litre Hemi 265 engine and a four speed floor shift manual transmission were standard on the Drifter.\nIn spite of its option pack status, Chrysler marketed the model as the Chrysler Drifter without using the name \"Valiant\". The Drifter pack was also available on the Chrysler Valiant Utility, which was also marketed as the \"Chrysler Drifter\".\nThe Drifter styles of the panel van and utility body ended when Chrysler Australia discontinued the CL series. The 1978 CM Valiant range did not include these styles.

            "text": "Gordon Cullen\n\nThomas Gordon Cullen (9 August 1914 \u2013 11 August 1994) was an influential British architect and urban designer who was a key motivator in the Townscape movement. Cullen presented a new theory and methodology for urban visual analysis and design based on the psychology of perception, such as on the human need for visual stimulation and the notions of time and space. He is best known for the book \"Townscape\", first published in 1961. Later editions of \"Townscape \" were published under the title \"The Concise Townscape\".\nBiography.\nCullen was born in Calverley, Pudsey, near Leeds, Yorkshire, England. He studied architecture at the Royal Polytechnic Institution, the present day University of Westminster, and subsequently worked as a draughtsman in various architects' offices including that of Berthold Lubetkin and Tecton, but he never qualified or practised as an architect.\nBetween 1944 and 1946 he worked in the planning office of the Development and Welfare Department in Barbados, as his poor eyesight meant that he was unfit to serve in the British armed forces. He later returned to London and joined the \"Architectural Review\" journal, first as a draughtsman and then as a writer on planning policies. There he produced a large number of influential editorials and case studies on the theory of planning and the design of towns. Many improvements in the urban and rural environment in Britain during the 1950s and 1960s. He was also involved in the Festival of Britain in 1951. One of the few large scale Cullen works on public display is the mural in the foyer of the Erno Goldfinger designed Greenside Primary School in west London, completed in 1953. His 1958 ceramic mural in Coventry, depicting the history of the city and its post-war regeneration, is on a much grander scale though now relocated away from its original central location.\nHis techniques consisted largely of sketchy drawings that conveyed a particularly clear understanding of his ideas, and these had a considerable influence on subsequent architectural illustration styles. He also illustrated several books by other various authors, before writing his own book - based on the idea of Townscape - in 1961. The Concise Townscape has subsequently been republished around 15 times, proving to be one of the most popular books on Urban Design in the 20th Century.\nIn 1956 Cullen became a freelance writer and consultant and, in the years immediately following he advised the cities of Liverpool and Peterborough on their reconstruction and redevelopment plans. In 1960 he was invited to India to advise on the planning aspects of the Ford Foundation's work in New Delhi and Calcutta and so in 1962 he and his family lived in India for 6 months while he worked on the projects. Later, his work included planning advice to the city of Glasgow and during the 1980s the London Docklands Development Corporation.\nFor a while Cullen teamed up with a student, David Price, and they formed an architectural firm together - Price &amp; Cullen. They won a competition in London in the 1980s and together designed and oversaw the building of the Swedish Quays housing development in Docklands. They worked together until 1990 as Price's first child was born and because Cullen's health was deteriorating. Price died in 2009 at the age of 53.\nCullen lived in the small village of Wraysbury (Berkshire) from 1958 until his death, aged 80, on 11 August 1994, following a serious stroke. After his passing, David Gosling and Norman Foster collected various examples of his work and put them together in the book \"Visions of Urban Design\".\nAwards.\nIn 1972 he was elected Honorary Fellow of the RIBA. In 1975 he was awarded with an RDI for illustration and Townscape. The following year he was awarded a medal from The American Institute of Architects. In 1978 he was appointed a CBE for his contribution to architecture from Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom.",

She gives Alice a pair of her knitting needles, and asks her if she can row. As Alice begins to answer, she realizes that they are in a little boat, and that the needles have turned into oars.

            "text": "The Sheep\n\nThe Sheep is a character, created by Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, a.k.a. Lewis Carroll. It appeared in Dodgson's 1871 book, \"Through the Looking-Glass\", the sequel to his 1865 book \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.\"\nStoryline.\nThe Sheep is first mentioned in the fifth chapter of \"Through the Looking-Glass\", \"Wool and Water\". The White Queen is talking to Alice, when she suddenly starts \"baa-ing\" and then seems to 'wrap herself in wool'. Alice figures out she is in a shop, and that The White Queen has turned into a sheep. The Sheep sits in her chair knitting as Alice looks around the shop. She gives Alice a pair of her knitting needles, and asks her if she can row. As Alice begins to answer, she realizes that they are in a little boat, and that the needles have turned into oars. As they glide along the water, the Sheep repeatedly shouts out \"Feather\", which means to lift the oar blades out of the water, turn them to a horizontal plane and swing them toward the bow so they don't get 'caught' in the water.
